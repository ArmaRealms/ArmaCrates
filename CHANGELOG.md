### Added:
- Added a toggle, which allows you to revert the chance made previously.
  - crazycrates.open.<crate_name> -> crazycrates.deny.open.<crate_name>
- The configuration option can be found in the `config.yml` i.e. `root.use-new-permission-system`
  - This option likely won't be here forever, one of the systems will be default. You'll be notified when that happens.
