### Added:
- A different way to apply `CustomModelData` to an item, this addition avoids an error that isn't an error from appearing. `-1` means no custom model data will be applied!
  - Our documentation will be updated with the new format sometime this weekend however you can keep using the old format.
  - The old format `tripwire_hook#custom_model_data` will continue to work however consider this the deprecation notice.
  - Try and make an effort to use the new format please, you can look in the `examples` folder to see some applications of the format.
