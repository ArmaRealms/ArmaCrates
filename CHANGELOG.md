### Changes:
- Allow mass-open to be used on the following crate types:
  - QuadCrates
  - CasinoCrate
  - CosmicCrate
  - FireCracker
  - QuickCrate
- Updated logging messages for tiers in CasinoCrate
  - Only checking if a tier is null, rather than if the config option is empty, then checking if a tier is null.
- Moved calling the player prize event, and spawning fireworks to the method which gives the prize.
- De-bumped api-version to 1.21.1
  - Paper is still not out of experimental, which is why this is being done.
