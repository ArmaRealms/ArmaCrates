## Additions:

* Added the ability to override the menu button functionality to use your own menu through DeluxeMenus and any other gui
  plugin.
    * The config options have been automatically added to your config.yml and default to false, They can be found where
      you edit what the menu button looks like.

## Enhancements:

* Re-did how /crate admin handles giving keys, It expands the size of the inventory to 54 slots and adds a button at the
  bottom explaining how to get keys.
    * At the same time, This fixed an issue where the lore of the keys given were different. Will it be paginated?
      Someday
