### Update
- Added 2 new toggles in the config.yml which allow you to switch what right/left do when interacting with physical or virtual crates.
- Added the ability to migrate user data with ExcellentCrates by adding -data to the command which ignores migrating crates.
  - `crazycrates migrate ExcellentCrates -d`
- Updated the migration command format
  - `crazycrates migrate -mt <migration_type> -c <crate_name> -d`
    - `-d`/`--data` is used for migrating from user data from other crate plugins.
      - If you wish to migrate from a crates plugin like ExcellentCrates, Do not use `-d`
    - `-mt`/`--migration_type` is used to specify what migration type you want to use.
    - `-c`/`--crate` is used for supplying a crate name.
- Fixed multiple issues with the ExcellentCrates Migrator.
